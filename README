================

Send SIGSTOP to the process that got ENOSPC on write(2).

This is useful if you don't have access to program sources but program don't
bother it for handle ENOSPC correctly, when it can do some reclaim.

The great example is sort(1), when you use it for large amount of data you
could forgot to monitor available space on --temporary-directory, and it could
fail even if it is already sort 99% of data. What you could to is move some
files into another partition and create symbolic links into the old location
(but only if sort(1) don't hold that file descriptors, but usually the answer
is -- no), or you ould even copy files into another server (if current don't
have free space), and create pipes that will read files from remote server
on fly.
But sure sort can't do such things for you, but you could!
